The Home Automation System is a smart home solution designed to enable remote control
of various household appliances and systems. These devices include lighting, HVAC systems,
security cameras, door locks, and more. The idea is to integrate these home devices into a
network that can be controlled through a smartphone app or web interface. By doing so, the
user can control these devices from anywhere, be it within the house or remotely when away
from home.
The automation system can work on preset schedules or be activated based on real-time
inputs from sensors (like motion or temperature sensors). Itâ€™s designed to make home
management more convenient, energy-efficient, and secure.
